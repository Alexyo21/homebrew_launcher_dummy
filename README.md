# Homebrew Launcher Wrapper
This dummy app acts as a wrapper to the Luma3DS homebrew launcher. It has a custom banner, icon and logo and only enough code to show an image with instructions on how to use the Luma3DS homebrew launcher in case it's not set up properly. (Note that this code may be a bit old, but it does its job.)
